Magic the Pricing is a simple game where the player is a given two Magic the Gathering cards and the player must guess which card is more expensive of the two. The prices of the cards come from the market price on TCG Player and foils are not included to remove confusion for the player. 

This game tests your knowledge on how Magic players value the multitude of cards. Is it art, is it power, is it mana cost? Probably a mixture.
